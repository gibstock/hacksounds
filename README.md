* I started this project a little later than I wished I could. This was a great exercise and taught me a few things: 
1. Be on time
2. Have an idea ahead of time of what you want to make. ( I started the project with zero idea of what I was going to do)
3. Allow time for researching wierd things happening.
4. Allow time for uploading issues.
5. Learn how to write a proper README...

Thank you!
